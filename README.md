Hi! I'm Shannon Bruderer, a researcher with a background in Art History and Digital Humanities. In this repository, Iâ€™m sharing small, practical notebooks that I've created or come across during my research. These notebooks are designed to support social science analysis, providing simple, easy-to-follow code and methods. 

Feel free to explore, adapt, and contribute!
